Copy and paste this example prompt to your AI coding assistant:

Build a complete mobile web app following AGENTS.md exactly. Include:
- Install all dependencies (run npm install commands)
- All setup (dependencies, CSS imports, SaltThemeProvider)
- App.tsx with tab navigation
- 3 tab pages (Home, Details, Settings) using the Tab Page Template
  * use the web page image as a refernce for the Home page and convert to a responsive view and ensure to match the background color in the image
  * use the hand drawn image as a reference for the Details page and apply some subtle background colors that are appropriate for the app style
- Add a light mode dark mode toggle switch on the settings page
- Tab bar with Salt icons

Use the templates in AGENTS.md - do not create custom patterns.
